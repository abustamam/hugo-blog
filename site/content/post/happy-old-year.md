Happy 2017! And here's to a happy 2018. 

There's a tradition, at least in the Western world, where every time the Year number increments by one, people are supposed to resolve to make themselves better. It's why we oftentimes see gym memberships spike at the beginning of the year, because people make resolutions to work out more regularly. These are commonly known as "New Year's Resolutions," and people love making them, even if they have zero plan or commitment to keep them.

Recently, I've seen a lot of people, including myself, forego this tradition because it is really, *really* hard to maintain a resolution for a whole year. Or, because they've never had a plan or commitment to keep them, so they figure they may as well not even make one.

I've tried to think about why this is. I've come up with a single reason:

**People are too quick to put the past in the past.**

Let me clarify what I mean by this. 

## Forgetting the past too quickly

At the end of 2016, which was arguably a Very Terrible Year™, I witnessed a lot of people saying, "I can't wait for 2016 to be over with! 2017 can't be worse than this!"

At the end of 2017, which was arguably an Even More Terrible Year™, I witnessed a lot of people saying, "I can't wait for 2017 to be over with. It was so much worse than 2016."

What I gathered from these exchanges was that many people just wanted to jump ahead into the future and forget that the year ever happened. 

This is very, very bad. It's why we, as individuals, do the same things over and over again, wondering why things don't get better, and why we, as a society, are slowly approaching the critical mass of Holy Crap I Can't Believe I Live In This World™.

When we try to ignore the terrible, and sometimes traumatic, events of our lives or society, we give up a very important thing -- lessons learned.

How can we improve ourselves and prevent the same mistakes from happening if we never learn? 

On the flip side, when all things are going right with our lives and the world, we are happy, and oftentimes don't really care why things are going our way. We are often quick to assume we are all self-made, that we are indeed in control of our own destiny, but neglect the possibility that we may have been just "lucky" -- a product of circumstance and coincidence. 

## Look in the mirror, but look past yourself

In short, I believe we are losing our will to become better every year because of one thing: lack of reflection. 

I'm not talking about a daily journal or anything like that. I'm in a strange position where I believe in the power of tactile reinforcement, but I also hate writing with pen/paper. What I *am* talking about is just looking at certain areas of your life, and asking yourself the following questions:

1. What went well?
2. What did not go well or could have gone better?
3. What can I do this year/month/week/day/next time to make it go better?

Incidentally, these three questions work extremely well for just about anything. Presentations, projects, conversations, even workouts, can all be reflected upon with these three questions, and I guarantee you'll see at least *some* improvement each time. If you have a trusted friend, partner, or family member, you can ask *them* these questions for some "outside" feedback. 

These questions can put towards broad areas of your life, like "How was my whole life last year?" or they could be directed towards granular areas: "Annual coffee budget." It seems like everyone has different "spokes" of life they like to focus on, I am pretty lazy when it comes to this type of things so I've broadened it to three areas:

1. Health (nutrition & fitness)
2. Wealth (career & savings & charity)
3. Wisdom (relationships & mental & spirituality)

(Yes, I stole these three spokes from Ben Franklin's "Healthy Wealthy Wise" quote)

I've seen people with 8 spokes, 10 spokes, and I'm sure there are people with 20+ spokes. I can't keep track of more than 3 things in my head, as you may have noticed, so I do everything by 3's. Do what feels right to you, not just because some random Internet stranger said you should have 3. 

2015 had been one of the worst years of my life. Then I decided to get my act together, and then 2016 had been the best year of my life, until 2017 came along. That year was definitely the best year of my life, and I'm confident 2018 will be the best year of my life thus far as well. 

## Example

Here's how I evaluated one spoke of 2014:

Wealth:
- What went well:
    - not much, worked part-time minimum wage at a learning center
- What did not go well?
    - spent way too much money on fast food
    - $0 in savings
    - maxed out two credit cards, still have about $20k of school loans
- What can I do better next year?
    - **EVERYTHING**. No seriously though, I need to get my act together, get a better paying job. If I am unable to get a better paying job, I need to learn the skills that are necessary for good paying jobs. I also need to learn how to eat more cheaply, and save more money for emergencies.

That was the end of 2014. During the next year (2015), I invested *heavily* into my personal development. I spent almost all of my non-work hours either learning programming or learning how to get a job (and also applying for jobs). I learned how to market myself, how to find jobs that I'd like and be a fit for, and all the ins and outs of interviews and such.

This was the year I was elected president of my local Toastmasters group (June). This was also the year I became a Udacity Code Reviewer (Nov), quit that part-time job (also Nov), and got my first full-time job (Dec). Even though throughout most of 2015 I did not actually have any tangible gains, I built the foundation upon which I've been able to build my entire career. 

Just so you know, and I'm actually really proud of this, this past year (2017) I've been able to pay off **all** my school loans and *most* of my revolving credit card debt. Incidentally, it's not only due to making more money, but also due to me spending less money on things I don't need (fast food, coffee, energy drinks), which in turn is helpful for the Health spoke of my life. Having less debt and more savings is also good for my mental wellbeing, because of less stress. Sometimes, excelling in one spoke will allow you to excel in other spokes.

## Make amends with last year

The reason this post is titled "Happy Old Year" is because if you take nothing from this post, at the very least, I want you to make amends with every year that passes. 

I want you to spend some time, even if it's just 10 minutes, to reflect upon the happenings of the past year. 

I want you to take all the good things that happened in 2017, and I want you to be grateful for them. 

I want you to take all of 2017's shortcomings, and *forgive* them. 

It may be weird to be grateful for and to forgive a year, but it's better to start a year full of gratitude instead of baggage from last year. Don't let any year have that sort of power over you.

## The New Year's Revolution

If you're happy with your life right now and don't see a need for improvement, then it's perfectly fine to keep on your same track. 

However, if you're like me and are never satisfied with staying in the same place year after year, then it's time to take action.

This year, don't settle for mediocrity. 

This year, don't settle for the same habits and routines that have gotten you where you are right now. 

This year, lead the revolution against being mediocre.

This year, enlighten yourself to a better future. 

This year, live the life you've always wanted to live. 

This year, resolve to be **INCREDIBLE**.

This is your wake up call. Welcome to 2018. Show the world who's boss.
