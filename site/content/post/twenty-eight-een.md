![birthday](/images/2018/06/stencil.default--2-.jpg)

A couple days ago, I turned 28. Whoo! 

My birthday happens to fall in the middle of the year, which makes it a great time for reflection. Let's take a look at how I'm doing this year with my goals, which I just realized I never actually publicized. The theme is "growth," and here is what I'm growing this year:

1. financially
2. physically
3. mentally

Let's go down the list.

## Financially

![money](/images/2018/06/money.jpg)

For most of my adult life I've been chasing the almighty dollar. There's certainly nothing wrong with that, but I wanted a change. Rather than just learning how to make more money, I wanted to learn how to grow my money. Lots of people will say to just save more money, but there's always a ceiling on how much you can save -- there's never a limit to how much you can earn.

So I've begun educating myself in investment strategies, mainly just index/mutual funds. I made it a priority this year to max out my Roth IRA, something I had never done before, and with some discipline, I was able to max out _last_ year's fund, and made it a goal to max out this year's fund by the end of the year. It's amazing what one can do with a little bit of budgeting.

So everything's good on that front, but unfortunately, my portfolio isn't doing too well! To be fair, the rest of the markets aren't doing too well. My personal portfolio has YTD gains of ~1%, whereas the S&P 500 is at 2.7%, Foreign markets at -0.4%, and bonds at -2.1%. I'm currently following the moderately aggressive portfolio suggested at [Wahed](https://wahedinvest.com/), which includes Amana and Azzad growth/income funds, as well as some shares in IAU (gold).

The way I see it, these funds aren't going anywhere, and it's quite a few years until I retire, so my only regret is that I don't have more money to invest, because I see bad markets as a discount on great investments. 

The same can't be said of my cryptocurrency holdings. I just put a little bit of money in just to see what would happen, and since I've invested (late last year), Bitcoin (BTC) is up 30%, Ethereum (ETH) is up 107%, and Ethereum Classic (ETC) is up 32%. However, no one can guarantee that these currencies will exist tomorrow, so I view this as high-risk high-reward. I'm probably not going to cash our for a while though.

With regards to growing my income, I've actually published three courses since the beginning of the year. I self-published a course last year, but I think everyone agreed that it kinda sucked, but it was a great learning experience that gave me enough insight to publish these courses for Zenva:

[React Course](https://academy.zenva.com/product/build-web-applications-with-react/)
[Intermediate React/Redux](https://academy.zenva.com/product/intermediate-react-and-redux/)
[Introduction to GraphQL](https://academy.zenva.com/product/introduction-to-graphql/)

(note: I don't get compensation if you buy these courses, not even royalties, since I decided to take upfront payment)

Those were fun to record, and I look forward to publishing more in the future. 

Finally, there's this little cryptocurrency start-up that I somehow got involved in, called [Layer One](http://www.layerone.co/). We're in a private alpha currently, and I'm not really allowed to say much about the project, but suffice to say, it's been a great experience.

I've learned a lot (haven't earned a lot yet!) and get to work with great people. I'm not really sure why this is under the financial category since it hasn't grown my finances, but I couldn't figure out where else to put it.

### What I'm looking forward to

To be honest, I'm always just looking forward to my next pay increase, because then I have more options in terms of investments, location, etc. Due to company circumstances, I'm priced way below market value for someone of my skillset, and while I could technically just find a new job that would pay me market value or more, like at Intel, I value the stuff I work on over money, to an extent. I get to work on very interesting projects, such as a project I'm currently working on with MIT's logistics lab. It's not every day you get to say you're teaching grad students how to code.

I'm also looking forward to finally writing and releasing my free 7-day email course so that I have a better call to action in my mailing lists than just "sign up now!"

## Physically

![BeFunky-collage-1](/images/2018/06/BeFunky-collage-1.png)

Alright, so let's address the elephant in the room: the beard! 

I've been growing it since November of 17, and a couple months ago I decided to go all the way and get an entire beard maintenance kit, complete with comb, brush, oil, and balm. So now I have a daily beard routine. How do you like it? Should it be shorter? Longer? 

Though it may seem insignificant, my beard actually symbolizes something very significant -- self-discipline. Throughout most of my teens and adult life, I've suffered trichotillomania, which is basically a nervous disorder of sorts that causes people to pull at their hairs without realizing it. I didn't shave for a long time because I would nervously pull all of my hairs out. And I tried everything, from fidget cubes/spinners to even using a [Pavlok](https://pavlok.com/) to shock myself whenever I realized I was doing it, but to no avail.

So the fact that I've been able to grow my beard for over six months means that I've been able to refrain from pulling at it for six months. I still get the temptation to do so, and occasionally I do, but the desire to keep my lucious chin-locks outweighs my desire to pull out all my hairs, literally.

How did I do it? I'm not actually sure. I just decided I'd try for no-shave no-pull November. I didn't even incentivize myself with anything. I just kinda did it. I know that's not helpful for anyone who was looking to gain some insight on self-discipline here, but I don't want to say anything trite.

Enough about the beard, let's discuss my weight!

I've been pretty skinny pretty much all my life. So earlier this year I submit myself to a 2500+ calorie diet (my breakfast alone was 1000+ calories), plus started to learn some basic calisthenics (essentially, body-weight fitness). It was actually going pretty well; I'd gained about 10 lbs, but when Ramadan hit I regressed. Maybe I could consider that a "cut," and I can go back to bulking with better results, but maybe I just lost all my muscle gains. Who knows? I guess you'll have to "weight" until the next update :)

### What I'm looking forward to

At the time of writing, it is 5am, which is a little more than an hour after I ate breakfast. Right now, I'm just looking forward to dinner.

But I'm also looking forward to going back to my exercise routine, diet, and gaining the balance necessary for a full hand-stand. 

## Mentally

![france](/images/2018/06/france.jpg)

How does one grow mentally? I think it's by learning, reading, and also having new experiences. This year, in addition to my regular reading/listening routine (thanks Audible!), I've decided to learn French. For context, my wife's family is French, so it'd be nice to be able to communicate with them in their native languages. 

I don't really have a routine for this. I listened to [Paul Noble's French](https://www.amazon.com/Collins-French-Paul-Noble-Natural/dp/B004TLS0IU) series on Audible, and have a good grasp on how French works as a language. As such, I am able to read French news, albeit at a snail's pace, and with the help of [Word Reference](http://www.wordreference.com/), I can learn new vocabulary. 

As for speaking? Well, I speak very slowly, so it's been a struggle, but with more practice I'll get better. 

I've also signed up for a few new courses, such as [Gretchin Rubin's Four Tendencies course](https://courses.gretchenrubin.com/?utm_source=homeicon_diveinto_menu), Ramit Sethi's Mental Mastery (can't find a link but [here](https://www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com/products/) is a link to Ramit's other courses), and a few Islamic courses on [Al-Maghrib's online portal](http://www.almaghrib.online/) (note: this landing page is only active when a course is launching). 

... keyword, *signed up*. Of all the courses I've purchased this year, I've only gone through a few modules of Mental Mastery, and a Women in Islam course. Most of my information consumption is done on the road, or while I'm cooking or playing games, and those tend to be podcasts or audiobooks. I can listen to actual video courses when I'm doing passive activities of course, but it's hard because those tend to be on online portals, not somewhere centrally on an app (like Audible or Pocketcasts). This is something I'm actively working on, of... *course*. (maybe I should take a joke-telling course).

### What I'm looking forward to

There's a lot to look forward to in this regard. I look forward to holding a whole conversation in French, and I actually just stumbled upon [this list](https://www.fluentu.com/blog/french/french-podcasts/) of handy podcasts for French learners, so I'm going to choose a few podcasts and spend some extra time listening. There's no substitute for speaking, however. 

As for my courses, I'm just going to have to make some time for them, not really any way around that. It would probably help if I got into the habit of turning a course on whenever I'm performing a task that requires little mental effort, so I just need to build that habit up.

## Parting words

This was a long post, so if you made it this far, congrats! I wrote this mainly for my own benefit, since if I'm honest with myself, no one really cares about my life goals, but if you made it this far, it probably means that you care enough about your own life goals to read a post about someone else's life goals, so that you can keep yourself on track for your own life goals. Life goal-ception! 

If that's the case, then I would love to hear about your progress thus far in the year. What have you struggled with? What are your accomplishments? What are you looking forward to? Leave a note in the comments!
